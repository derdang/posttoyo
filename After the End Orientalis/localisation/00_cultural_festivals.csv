EVTDESC_jp_11;A servant pulls out a shakuhachi and gently serenades the entourage late into the night as lanterns illuminate the trees in a brilliant dance of light. Around you the soft murmurs of passerbys melt away in the wind as you reflect on your time outside the palace.;;;;;;;;;;;x

shogatsu_festival;Preparations for the Shogatsu Festival begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
festival_japanese1;As the year draws to a close, you retire to your chambers to contemplate on the celebrations to come. Every News Years in Japan, the Shogatsu Festival heralded in the News Years, a most joyous occassion that can be celebrated from the personal confidance of your family to the court and realm at large. As the night closes, you stroll towards the open screens where the moonlight dance on the lips of the window. In the peaceful moonlight, you ready your quill to begin inking invitations for most esteem guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festival1;The year’s end approaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_festival4;You have decided to organize an Shogatsu Festival in your realm. As no such celebration has any place being held quietly, you have invited all of your vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festival4;Send the invitations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_festival5;You have been invited to join [From.GetTitledFirstName] at the Shogatsu Festival this year, where traditional song and dance will be had for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festival5;I shall attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_festival5;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shogatsu_festival_accepted;You attend the Shogatsu Festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shogatsu_festival_declined;Your liege is notified of your refusal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_festival6;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused your invitation to the Shogatsu Festival, claiming [From.GetSheHe] has other plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festival6;A likely excuse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_festival7;The room is filled with the sounds of shuffling this way and that as last-minute arrangements for the veritable New Years feast is laid out. Soft music and the aroma of traditional foods accompany the hustle and bustle. A steady stream of guests take turns presenting you with New Years greetings. Finally, with preparations complete and most of the guests in their places, the merriment can begin. All in attendance raise their cups of sake. In a jovial voice you announce, “Kanpai!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festival7;Cheers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_festival8;The faces around you seem content, the atmosphere in the room warm and merry. Surveying the room, you see various groups playing games of cards. Some of the guests appear to have had a little too much to drink and have taken to singing famous songs of the era. Still others continue to eat, and some commotion draws your attention to a guest that nearly choked on mochi. All in all, a rather successful event to mark the end of the year and celebrate the coming of the new. Now that the feast is wrapping up, you must decide whether to continue the day with hatsumode, the first shrine visit of the year, or to retire to bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festival8;It would be wise to pay the gods a visit to start the New Year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_festival8;We can visit the shrines another time. Akemashite Omedeto!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_festival9;The party has comes to a close, and all of the guests begin to return to their homes. People are generally pleased with the celebrations this year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festival9;Ah, a good time indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_festivall0;The party has has come to a close. As you return home, you reflect on the high quality of this year's celebrations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festivall0;I will make sure to come again next time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_FORTUNATE_TRIP;A Fortunate Trip...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_festival11;You arrive with your entourage to the first shrine of the new year with the distant ring of bells in your ear. You pass under the tall red Torii and climb the stone stairs to the main shrine grounds. Noting the crowds of fellow attendees, you make your way to the basin which brims with water. Taking hold of a bamboo ladle, you gingerly cleanse your hands and mouth and finally the handle of the ladle itself before placing it back upon the basin’s edge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festival11;With ritual purification finished, you head towards the shrine itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_festival12;Before you lies the honden, the main building, itself. The saisen box sits before you while the ceremonial suzu bells hang from the eaves by a rope. Withdrawing a generous amount of coinage, you carefully throw them into the grated offering box. This done, you grasp a rope and ring the bell. You bow and clap twice, announcing your presence to the gods and silently clasp your hands together to make a prayer. After bowing once more, you walk away from the building.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festival12;Now to draw my fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_festival13;After browsing through the shrine’s merchandise and buying various charms, it is finally time to draw your fortune. You pay the shrine attendant and reach your hand into the box before you, rifling through it for a moment before choosing a single folded paper. Withdrawing your omikuji, you step away to slowly unfold the parchment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festival13;Does luck shine upon me..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_festival14;Hazure! To your dismay the slip of paper gives various prophecies for you fortune throughout the year, and it doesn’t look good. Probably best to put important plans on hold until next year. With a sour face you fold the omikuji and tie it to a near by tree, adding to countless other less-than-lucky fortunes. Better luck next year!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festival14;Who knew they actually included such bad fortunes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_festival15;Atari! To your great delight your omikuji details various prophecies about your life for the coming year, and all signs point to good fortune. It seems that it may be a year to set about on those grand plans you were considering. With a smile on your lips, you fold the paper back up and slip it into your pocket.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festival15;An offering is in order for the Seven Lucky Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_festival16;Your visit has come to an end. With thoughts of what the future will bring still on your mind and bags of charms in your hands, your group walk down the stone path and back under the red gate of the Torii, signifying a return to the material world. You board an awaiting palanquin as the sound of bells chime and the occasional firework sounds off. Cheers to the New Year!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_festival16;Akemashite Omedeto!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_jp_3;You send an invitation to the Shogatsu Festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
