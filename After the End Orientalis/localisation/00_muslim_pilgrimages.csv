#####ATE ISLAM EVENTS#####

### HAJJ REWRITEN EVENT ###

EVTTITLE_HAJJ;Performing the Hajj;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj201;Every Pious Muslim must at least complete the Hajj to the Great City of Mecca once in the thier life. Home to the myriad of important activities whose traditions have existed since the ancient times before the Event. As you embark on this journey, you can't help but watch your home fade into the distance, stately matters can wait, for you are have higher things to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_SEA_HAJJ;By Boat, I'll reach Mecca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_LAND_HAJJ;By Land, I'll reach Mecca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajj50;Your entourage makes its way for the harbor, where you will have to find a voyage to the land of the Prophet. You muse over the offers of "Safe Travels" that you have heard beckoned to you by a series of questionable men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjship;A merchant ship is fine enough, we will pay the fee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjpirates;These corsairs request little for travel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_piratemecca;"We're here, Milord!" One of the Corsairs calls to you. You are rapidly approaching a very small island, with no discerning features minus a few trees and a large black stone at its center. Wait... is this actually Mecca..? Mecca wasn't on an island...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_fakemecca;Well... I suppose... I will put faith in them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjfightpirates;This is highway — ehrm, maritime robbery! To arms!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HAJJCONTINUES;Through a miracle of superior tactics, the pirates lay dead, scattered across the island. Whilst you and your men have sustained injuries, their ships are laid bare to you. Your injured crew gains control of the vessel, and sets off once more, westward for Mecca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjcontinues;Onwards to Mecca!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajjfailedliar;Whilst you may have set out from home in a triumphant parade, returning back has been met with dozens of scowls. Its very obvious you didnt reach Mecca, and noone buys the lie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_failedhajj;How could we have failed so badly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajjfailed;Whilst you may have set out from home in a triumphant parade, returning back has been shameful. By one means or another — you failed to reach Mecca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_failedhajjliar;I suppose I had this coming...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajj62;Your entourage makes its way to the bazaar where you are to meet with a merchant company to make the land trek to the blessed lands of the Prophet. You muse over the offers of "Safe Travels" that you have heard beckoned to you by a series of questionable men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjlandroute;These merchants drive a hard bargain, we will pay the fee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjraiders;These "trustworthy" horsemen request little...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_fakemeccaland;Well... I suppose... I will put faith in them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjfightraidersland;Oh no a highway robbbery To arms!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HAJJLANDCONTINUE;Through a miracle of superior tactics, the raiders laid slain along the dust swept expanse of the plains. Whilst you and your men have sustained injuries, their ships are laid bare to you. Your injured crew gains control of the vessel, and sets off once more westward for Mecca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjpacificonwards;Onwards to Mecca!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_HAJJINDIA;The Port of Mumbai;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajjindia;Its been a long voyage from your homeland, and it has been full of obstacles. But at the sight of land, your stress evaporated. "Behold the Crown jewel of Maharashtra" A crew member calls out. Our ship steadily coasts into a large harbor beckoning with buildings blazon with the flags of the many faiths of the city.\n You pensively look out across the Harbor. Many ships of all sorts of queer design fill the harbor, as peculiar men wander the port harkening their wares. You watched amazed as the cosmopolitan city play host many faiths and theological debates between wise sages and muftis. But of course India is not your target so you turn your gaze westward to Mecca, will you turn back now or make the journey further west?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjsea;Do I have to choose?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_HAJJSAMARKAND;The Quarters in Samarkand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajjsamarkand;Its been a long trek from your home, and it has been full of obstacles. But at the sight of the bustling bazaar of Transoxiana territory, your stress evaporates. "Behold the jewel of Transoxiana!" A caravan member calls out. Our Caravan enters the bazaar of this gleaming city of Samarkand, full of wonder and life.\n You walk pensively through the markets in deep thought. When the armies of the Caliphs swept from the West to the Steppes the peoples here accepted the faith of the Prophet and in their dedication built great houses of wisdom. It is said that great scholars have made great contributions of sufi thought in ages long ago in these ancient ulemas. If any time was the time to turn around, it is now. But surely, with the great distance already travelled, it would all be for naught if you turned around now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjland;I will revisit these thoughts later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajj68;Your time venturing through the city has come to a close and with that it is undeniable that the greatest thing you will take from this land is...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjajfriend;My wonderful new friend, who will sail with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjajmoney;A great bounty of wealth I haggled for with the local traders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjajtech;A vast sum of knowledge I have acquired from the way these foreigners live.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajj69;While you are far from your home, seeing so many peoples and places of great splendor you began to second guess yourself and your journey so far, is this enough for one lifetime or press onwards to see the wonders of faith in the holy lands of the prophet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjgohome;Im lucky to be alive. This has been a grand journey, but I'll head home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjgohomelie;Those at home don't need to know the truth. I've already seen Mecca, anyway..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_onwards;What a bunch of nonsense. I will see Mecca or die trying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### ZIYARA EVENT ###

EVTTITLE_ZIYARA;A Trip to the Shrines;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj200;The Islamic World is a wide and diverse place. Having a rich history of blessed shrines, mosque and other features that can be just as important as the conducting the Hajj to [c_mecca.GetName]. Whether it be for shrines of the Walis or the dedications to the Prophet Muhammad, his family and companions, as a pious Muslim you may visit these blessed places anytime...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajjhadith;As you stop for camp one evening, you notice that an old man in poor clothing has made camp at the same place. The man offers to tell you a hadith he has if you can spare him some bread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjhadithyes;Listen to the old man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjhadithno;It is just an old man...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIP_LISTEN_TO_HADITHHAJJ;You listen carefully to the old man's hadith.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### ASHURA EVENT ###

celebrate_ashura;Commemorate Ashura;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celebrate_ashura_desc;Ashura commemorates the martyrdom of Hussayn ibn Ali, grandson of the Prophet, in a battle against the tyrannical Caliph Yazid on the plains of Karbala. Ashura is one of the most important holy days in Shia Islam, and its commemmoration among the faithful has survived until the present day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ashura_decision;You begin commemmorating Ashura.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ashura_timer;Recently Commemmorated Ashura;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_1;The month of Muharram approaches - and with it, the solemn reminder of Ashura. The revolution of the third Imam, Hussayn, Alayhi Salam, will not be forgotten and will not go in vain. The struggle on Karbala's plain has ignited a flame that will forever remain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_1;Labayka ya Hussayn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_ashura_begins;You begin commemmorating Ashura.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_2;The anniversary of the first day of the battle in Karbala has arrived, and with it, mourners in black flock the streets. As you watch a Taziya reenactment of the battle, you contemplate to yourself the virtue of righteous resistance. The Imam was truly brave to fight against the tyrant of his time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_2;Death with dignity is better than life with humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ashura_2;Better to live and fight another day, in my opinion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_3;Soon after the events at Karbala, a curious tradition of self-flagellation, or Tatbir, grew among some more zealous Shi'a. A theological debate has broken out before you, as scholars argue whether or not Tatbir is permissible - self-damage is usually considered haram, but some stubbornly adhere to the tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_3;I will join the mourners myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ashura_3;Tatbir is a problematic practice, and so I must ban it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_4;On this ninth day, several prominent events occurred - the Tyrant's army besieged the Imam and his companions in Karbala, and preparations for battle were made. Many of the faithful go to Mosques and engage in charity - perhaps you should, as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_4;Make it so - distribute alms to the poor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ashura_4;I am indisposed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_5;The tenth day of Muharram is here, and commemoration reaches a high point. On this day, the Imam, most of his family, and all of his companions were martyred by the forces of The Tyrant. Though the sacrifice at Karbala happened long ago, its lessons are learned from even to this day. Your thoughts are interrupted by a large shout, as the crowd chants "Ya Hussayn!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_5;Every day is Ashura, every land is Karbala.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_6;It has been forty days since the commemoration of Ashura. Traditionally, many would make a pilgrimage to the shrine of the Imam, but as this is unfeasible, many of the devout choose to fast on this day in final commemoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_6;I will join the fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ashura_6;I do not think that is necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ashura_6;I cannot fast - I am at war!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_7;Unfortunately, war has come to your realm in the middle of Ashura. All commemmorations must cease immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
