If we win, their mandala realm will be §Rforcibly destroyed§! and all of its vassals will be set free for easy pickings.

succession_crisis_mandala_1;An auspicious succession...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succession_crisis_mandala_1_desc;With your ascension to the throne it is expected that you will build your own radiance together with your subject who look wearily upon you. In hush tones you might be able to hear the murmurs of dissent among your late kin's once loyal vassals. You stand proud before the crowd scanning for those that may be loyal to you. Despite such efforts it seems that it will require you to martial a display that can impress them into joining your great mandala as their enlightened and glorious sovereign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_OPTA_MANDALA3;Why aren't they impressed....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_OPTB_MANDALA3;They will come to fear my power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succession_crisis_mandala_2;An auspicious succession...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succession_crisis_mandala_2_desc;You tirelessly displayed your might before the court but little praise can be seen or heard from your subjects, your eyes dart anxiously around for even a passing glance from the highest decorated of your subjects but to no avail. Your gaze drifts before an imposing figure whose age and renown is known throughout the land as he simply sighs and begins to speak "Though you are a spawn of the late sovereign, you have yet to impress us with your might." You stand there stunned, was not your display of the sacred rituals enough to win the hearts and minds?! He continues "It has come to my attention that we your subjects will need you to display your birthright before us" as he draws his arms against yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_OPTA_MANDALA4;Wait, I surrender...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_OPTB_MANDALA4;I shall put you in your place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succession_crisis_mandala_3;A Fleeting Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
succession_crisis_mandala_3_desc;Your display remains unimpressive and like a lotus set adrift your vassals leave your court without so much as a good word upon their fickle tongues. In the next several days it has become impossible to maintain the discontent of the realm as your former subjects come to listen to your wayward governors and lords more than your own words. Soon time has come where even your influence barely extends to your immediate domain. A new fracturing has come to claim another realm within the infinite spirals of the mandala.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_OPTA_MANDALA5;and so the cycle starts anew...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
