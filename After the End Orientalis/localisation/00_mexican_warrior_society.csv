HFP_500_DESC_W;[combatant_1.GetFirstNameWithNick], a [combatant_1.GetSocietyRank] in my lodge, is [combatant_1.GetNegativeDuelSkillTerm] sparr at best. It is shameful for someone like [combatant_1.GetHerHim] to be so woefully unready should [Root.Society.GetName] call upon [combatant_1.GetHerHis] aid! Perhaps I should encourage [combatant_1.GetHerHim] to spar with another member?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HFP_501_DESC_W;[combatant_1.GetFirstNameWithNick] managed to best [combatant_2.GetFirstNameWithNick] handily after a short match. A cheering crowd heaved [combatant_1.GetFirstName] up on their shoulders after the victory, hoisting [combatant_1.GetHerHim] over to the lodge to celebrate. [combatant_1.GetSheHeCap] will become a renowned sparr yet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_14001_ambition_W;Upon returning from a local bout, I have been talking to [student.GetBestName]. The [student.GetManWoman] does not understand the urge for adrenaline, whatsoever. "What about the fame it brings your family?", I argue, recounting the swarms of admirers I had to fight through to get here. [student.GetSheHeCap] sighs, seemingly unimpressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14001_patience_W;Observing yet another game of [Root.GetWarriorLodgeCompetitionType], and [student.GetTitledFirstName] storming off with a sullen expression on [student.GetHerHis] face, it occurs to me how my [student.GetRootRelation] sorely lacks patience. "It is useful in ring as well", I mumble, scratching my chin, contemplating offering [student.GetHerHim] some guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14001_diligence_W;Watching [student.GetBestName] in the training grounds is always interesting. There is something about [student.GetHerHis] fighting technique that comes off as half-hearted, and [student.GetHerHis] cape, as well as the mask, seem like they could use a little more caring for... "[student.GetFirstName], could I have a word?", I interrupt the sparring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14001_bravery_W;As a sparr, [student.GetSheHe] needs me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HF_14001_diligence_W;Let's talk costume care and etiquette, my good [student.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14002_bravery_W;"I hear you are turning down matches", a [teacher.GetManWoman] sounds behind me.

Putting an arm over my shoulder, [teacher.GetSheHe] continues: "I could help you! You just need a little guidance, my good [Root.GetManWoman]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14002_ambition_W;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from a local bout.

"You know, you always seem so content with what you have, [Root.GetFirstName]" [teacher.GetSheHe] says. "I could help you hone your ambition", [teacher.GetSheHe] presses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14002_diligence_W;[teacher.GetBestName] is watching me in the training grounds. There is something inquisitive about it, and I am not surprised when [teacher.GetSheHe] comes over, asking about the routines I keep, "maintenance-wise, for your costume".

EVTDESC_HF_14006_ambition_W;When [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] said we were going to spend several days in a library, my heart sank.

"I knew you had it in you", [teacher.GetSheHe] says cheerfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14006_diligence_W;When my [teacher.GetRootRelation] suggested we spend a few afternoons reorganizing [teacher.GetHerHis] costume room, I expected to be bored within moments. Yet [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to keep my interest for several days, and I find myself asking questions I have never even thought of before. I am almost embarrassed by my former attitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14007_ambition_W;"You want us to spend time, voluntarily, in the library?" [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] nods. "Yes! I think you'll enjoy hearing about old sparer," [teacher.GetSheHe] laughs, [teacher.GetHerHis] eyes aglitter. A few hours later, I understand. The tales are fascinating! "Some make for decent role models", I admit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14007_diligence_W;"Surely, your costume room must already be in order?" I offer, but [teacher.GetTitledFirstName] shakes [teacher.GetHerHis] head. "This is more about mastering the principles behind the organizing, than the organizing itself" the [teacher.GetManWoman] explains. A few days later, I admit, I have learned some valuable techniques and practices...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14008_diligence_W;[teacher.GetTitledFirstName] put me to cleaning [teacher.GetHerHis] costume room. And everything I did was wrong...! The [teacher.GetManWoman] kept giving me counter-effective instructions and muttering under [teacher.GetHerHis] breath about "impossible", and "why do I even try". If there was a lesson in this, I do not think I understood it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_14009_diligence_W;My [student.GetRootRelation] and I are finally done organizing my costume room. [teacher.GetTeachingMomentResult];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16006;"Not so fast", a voice whispers in my ear, as I'm preparing to turn in for the night. I turn around, but something stings my throat. A dagger? "We WILL spar, dear [Root.GetFirstName], do you understand? Nod if you understand." Panic pounding in my chest, I nod, carefully as to not hurt myself further. "Good", the [From.GetManWoman] says, and pulls away into the dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_16006_TT;You gulp, as it seems you have no choice. You will spar [From.GetTitledName]!, in a few days time.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16007;While attempting to talk some sense into [combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName], in regards to [combatant_2.GetHerHim] declining my challenge, I have decided to sneak into [combatant_2.GetHerHis] [combatant_2.GetCapitalHolding]. Fidgeting with the dagger in my sleeve, I have a good feeling about this, when suddenly I hear people shouting. "Who goes there?" they demand, and I am surrounded by guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16009_default;As the match goes on, [combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName] and I get more and more desperate with grapples and finishing moves. I finally grab him and attempt to land a final blow, but [combatant_2.GetSheHe] overpowers me and flings us out of the ring, with both of our heads landing... awkwardly on the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_16011_intrigue_default;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is moving sluggishly. Perhaps it's due to the special breakfast I had my agents prepare for [other_combatant.GetHerHim], but it is clear that the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] is not in [other_combatant.GetHerHis] best form. Before anyone catches on, I attack with full force. It feels almost too easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_A;My body is cramping, as [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] braces for another attack. The following moments are a blur, blood suddenly everywhere, somebody shouting. "Did [Root.GetTitledFirstName] just kill [other_combatant.GetHerHim]?!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_B;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] throws out [other_combatant.GetHerHis] moves [other_combatant.GetClumsilyElegantly]. The fight has gone on forever, and my muscles are beginning to ache. With the remainder of my strength I kill [other_combatant.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_C;My opponent seems to be getting tired, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] moves becoming slower. Strengthened by the cheers of the crowd, I kill [other_combatant.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_A_W;It seems like ages have passed in the ring as both [other_combatant.GetBestName] and I begin to use more and more dangerous moves. Thinking quickly, I perch myself upon the ropes and leap forward towards [other_combatant.GetHerHim], elbow in the front. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] doesn't last long...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_B_W;[other_combatant.GetBestName] and I are starting to grab without any plan, wildly flailing on the floor of the ring as we both attempt to pin each other. I finally get out of [other_combatant.GetHerHis] grip and quickly punch [other_combatant.GetHerHim] in the throat. I watch in awe as they collapse instantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_C_W;[other_combatant.GetBestName] is quickly becoming an equal in my mind as my unrelenting fury of blows seemingly do not land. However, I spot a hole in [other_combatant.GetHerHis] defense, and I land a series of hard blows against [other_combatant.GetHerHis] body. I step back when I realize that blood is seeping out of [other_combatant.GetFirstName]'s mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_D_W;I am running out of options as [other_combatant.GetBestName] does not fall prey to my style. I decide to go all in and attempt to incapacitate [other_combatant.GetHerHim]. I extend my foot, trip my foe, and give [other_combatant.GetHerHim] a series of blows. It is not long until I realize [other_combatant.GetHerHim] stopped breathing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_16011_intrigue_A_attacker;My [other_combatant.GetRootRelation] seems unaware that the little wound I inflicted is what is causing [other_combatant.GetHerHis] limbs to slowly go numb... "Valiant effort!" I proclaim, watching [other_combatant.GetHerHis] sluggish movements. When [other_combatant.GetSheHe] lunges at me, I carefully step aside, letting [other_combatant.GetHerHis] subsequent collapse look like a failed attack. The poison must have reached [other_combatant.GetHerHis] heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_16011_intrigue_A_defender_spymaster;I'm not sure why my [Root.GetMySpymasterName] wants to inspect my equipment prior to the duel  surely, [job_spymaster.GetHerHis] comment about poison were in jest!

EVTDESC_HF_16011_intrigue_A_defender_self;"Impressive!" [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] splutters, on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] knees in the [Root.Capital.GetGroundDesc].

EVTDESC_HFP_16012_A;Just as I begin to think that I am wearing my opponent down, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] lunges at me, with more force than so far displayed. Sweat drips down my forehead, when suddenly, I hear someone shouting, describing the scene incredulously. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] has managed to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16012_B;The fight has been going on for some time and it's with some effort I'm still throwing out moves, [Root.GetClumsilyElegantly]. [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] looks tired too, but suddenly [other_combatant.GetSheHe] kills me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16012_C;Each movement of my body is becoming heavier, and I'm struggling to focus on my opponent, as the crowd cheers [other_combatant.GetHerHim] on. My vision is blurry when [other_combatant.GetSheHe] kills me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_16012_intrigue_default;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is moving [other_combatant.GetClumsilyElegantly], yet I can barely even muster the strength to hold myself upright. "You look tired, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [other_combatant.GetSheHe] says, stepping closer. I want to protest, but my head is swimming. Smirking, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] swings [other_combatant.GetHerHis] fist, and kills me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16012_A_W;Ages have seemingly passed as [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] and I begin to use more dangerous moves. Suddenly, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] perches [other_combatant.GetHerHim]self upon the ropes of the ring, and jumps towards me. The last thing I hear are my ribs breaking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16012_B_W;[other_combatant.GetBestName] and I are starting to throw out any move that comes to the top of our heads. [other_combatant.GetBestName] rips [other_combatant.GetHerselfHimself] out of my grasp, and punches me in the throat. I collapse attempting to take in air with no luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16012_C_W;In both speed and strength I am matching my foe [other_combatant.GetBestName]. However, I left a hole in my defense, and [other_combatant.GetBestName] quickly takes advantage in this, and lands multiple devastating blows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
you_lose_the_match_tt;You lose the match.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_mock_duel_A;The match has gone on for what feels like hours  the initial confidence I felt has begun to wane, and my movements are getting sloppy. Then, just as my knees are about to give way under me, I [other_combatant.GetWrestlingInjuringBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_mock_duel_B;As the match begins, [other_combatant.GetTitledName] comes at me slowly. I offer [other_combatant.GetHerHim] my best taunting smile, and it does not take long before I have seen to [other_combatant.GetWrestlingInjuringBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_mock_duel_C;The onlookers are cheering for me, as I swing my fists with increasing enthusiasm. When it's over, [other_combatant.GetTitledName] is on the ground, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face red with embarrassment. I shrug, smiling to the crowd, and at my opponent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_intrigue_default;For a moment I am worried that [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is going to fall, but [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] does not appear to notice my sabotage. All I need to do is land a blow in the right area and... There! The [other_combatant.GetManWoman] is spinning, clutching [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetBodyPartInjured], screaming in pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_default_A;"It's a good day for sparring!", I chuckle, stretching out all the necessary muscles. "Enough talking", my opponent growls. Soon, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is lying face down in the [Root.Capital.GetGroundDesc], as I have seen to [other_combatant.GetWrestlingInjuringBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_default_B;My opponent looks nervous, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] mask a little ill-fitting, and I briefly contemplate asking if [other_combatant.GetSheHe] would rather do this another day... A moment later, I snap out of it, letting the fresh morning air sharpen my senses instead. The [other_combatant.GetCharacterLook] [other_combatant.GetManWoman] is soon on the ground, groaning in pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_default_C;The sun is beginning to set when I meet with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName], my body ready. After [other_combatant.GetSheHe] [other_combatant.GetClumsilyElegantly] dodges one attack, my next one lands perfectly. Frantically, the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] attempts to cover [other_combatant.GetHerHis] injured [other_combatant.GetBodyPartInjured], but I have rarely seen such a purple bruise...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_A_W;As the match goes on, I begin to recall the training in the Eagle tactics. I rip myself from [other_combatant.GetBestName]'s grasp and perch upon the ropes. Although the impact of the descent did incapacitate [other_combatant.GetBestName], it also injured me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_B_W;The match between [other_combatant.GetBestName] and I quickly turned into a grappling match, with the tide rarely turning in the midst of it. After temporarily losing my footing and receiving a blow for it, I found an opening in my opponent's defense, and ended the match soon after.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_C_W;[other_combatant.GetBestName], being exceptionally defensive in the match, did not leave much room for my style to take its effects. After each of us landed multiple blows, I finally got the upper hand when I exploited one of [other_combatant.GetBestName]'s wide attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_default_E;I am swinging my arms wildly, when suddenly, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] shrieks in pain. Stopping my crazed flailing, I am stuck staring at the mess I have made. It seems I have managed to [other_combatant.GetWrestlingInjuringBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_mock_duel_A;A simple [combatant_1.GetDuelType] or not, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] has an air of unquestioned confidence about [other_combatant.GetHerHim]. When I charge, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] snickers. At the end of it all, I am lying on the ground, after my opponent made sure to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_mock_duel_B;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] charges at me, and has soon managed to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe]. The crowd does not seem impressed by my effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_mock_duel_C;The onlookers are cheering for [other_combatant.GetTitledName], as [other_combatant.GetSheHe] is swinging [other_combatant.GetHerHis] fists with increasing enthusiasm. When it's over, the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] looks at me with pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_intrigue_default;I instructed the squire to weaken one of my opponent's body parts, but I am having trouble spotting the sabotage. "Are you making a wish?" [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] asks, impatiently  we have been at this for hours, and my scheming has lead nowhere. I back away, clutching my [GetBodyPartInjured]. [GetSeverityOfInjuryCap].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_default_A;"Don't look so glum", [other_combatant.GetTitledName] offers. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] has me on the ground, *again*, and I am losing any patience I ever had. "You oaf-" I begin, but I collapse from the pain. The [other_combatant.GetManWoman] has managed to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe], and the clear scent of blood has me dizzy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_default_B;I am not sure what is wrong with me, but nothing I do has any effect on [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]. "Come on, don't give up already!" [other_combatant.GetSheHe] commands, disgruntlement clear in [other_combatant.GetHerHis] voice. I try to rise, but I can't. My [Root.GetBodyPartInjured] hurts like it never has before. "I am just going to rest a little, here in the [Root.Capital.GetGroundDesc]", I mumble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_default_C;Pain is throbbing in my [GetBodyPartInjured], and I clench my jaw, trying not to cry. "It's not over!" I growl, but my opponent is lowering [other_combatant.GetHerHis] fists. The last rays of the evening sun envelops [other_combatant.GetHerHim], and suddenly, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] looks like a warrior sent by the heavens themselves...! In an attempt to say something about it, I pass out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_default_E;[other_combatant.GetTitledName] is swinging [other_combatant.GetHerHis] fists wildly, when suddenly, a shriek of pain cuts through the air. Staggering, I realize that the voice is my own  my opponent has managed to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_A_W;[other_combatant.GetBestName] and I were duking it out pretty evenly over the course of our match until [other_combatant.GetSheHe] ripped [other_combatant.GetHerselfHimself] out of my grasp. All of a sudden, [other_combatant.GetFirstName] did an Monkey move, and it was over. Although I was defeated, I saw [other_combatant.GetFirstName] stumble away from me, grasping [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetBodyPartInjured].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_B_W;The match between [other_combatant.GetBestName] and I soon devolved into a grappling mess, with the chances of victory ebbing and flowing. After I caught [other_combatant.GetFirstName] off-guard, I had my blow returned to be tenfold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_C_W;My defensive strategy seemed to be working against [other_combatant.GetBestName]'s aggressive style, until I left myself wide open. Even though in my struggle I landed some blows, I was soon pinned and defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16015;I was in a defensive stance, locking eyes with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]. The crowd began to whisper, as my opponent fidgeted awkwardly, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face growing paler. I thought [other_combatant.GetSheHe] was about to faint, when the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] started running, away from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16016;Still shivering, I cannot explain what happened. When it all came down to it, my legs gave way and I simply... I fled the match! I am such a coward! Why did I ever agree to this in the first place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16017;Just as I [other_combatant.GetWrestlingInjuringBlow], [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] manages to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe]. However, the crowd is chanting MY name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16017_B;My [GetBodyPartInjured] hurts, but it somehow doesn't seem as bad as what my opponent is suffering. "I'm not done!", [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] says, through gritted teeth, but then [other_combatant.GetSheHe] lies back down on the ground, rolling around wildly. When I step closer [other_combatant.GetSheHe] splutters: "No no, I'm done! I yield!".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16017_C;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is taken aback when I [other_combatant.GetWrestlingInjuringBlow]. "[Root.GetTitledFirstName] wins!" someone proclaims, and my opponent groans. I am ignoring the pain in my [GetBodyPartInjured], but I have a suspicion [GetSeverityOfInjury].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16017_A_W;As I drop from the skies on to my opponent, I realize that I landed a bit wrong. Although I did injure my [GetBodyPartInjured], the referee proclaims me the victor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16017_B_W;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]'s hits have been damaging to me, but I bear it and land a devastating blow. Which knocks [other_combatant.GetHerHim] down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16017_C_W;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] and I seem to equally trade blows throughout the match, however, I find a weakness and make good work of it. Although I am in pain, [other_combatant.GetBestName] is on the ground, groaning in pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16018;Just as I [other_combatant.GetWrestlingInjuringBlow], [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] manages to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe]. Dizzy, I can just about make out the sounds of the crowd: it is not my name they are chanting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16018_B;"No, I can still fight!" I say, dropping to my knees, sensing my own lie. Even though [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] has clearly injured [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetBodyPartInjured], [other_combatant.GetSheHe] has been proclaimed the winner. Sighing, I ponder my own worst injury. I have a feeling [Root.GetSeverityOfInjury].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16018_C;"You don't give up, do you?" my opponent laughs. "I've thought about it", I mutter, attempting to stand. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] did just [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe]... As I slump back on the ground, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] smiles in triumph.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16018_A_W;When [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] climbed up on the ropes and began [other_combatant.GetHerHis] descent, I knew it was the end for me. Although [other_combatant.GetSheHe] did win, they did hurt themselves in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16018_B_W;Even though I was wailing on [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName], [other_combatant.GetSheHe] did not seem ready to quit. When I left myself too wide after an attempted shot, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] gave me a devastating blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16018_C_W;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] and I were trading blows pretty equally, until [other_combatant.GetSheHe] spots and weakness in my office and grapples me, not letting go until [other_combatant.GetSheHe] makes the match-ending move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16019_default;[other_combatant.GetTitledName] has already managed to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe], when [other_combatant.GetSheHe] lets out an angry grunt. Before I know it, I am begging for mercy, but [other_combatant.GetSheHe] is beyond reasoning. The last thing I hear is the shocked gasp of the crowd, and a soft thud, which can only be my head hitting the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16019_intrigue;[other_combatant.GetTitledName] has already managed to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe], when something twisted passes over [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face. I barely register the glint of something metal in [other_combatant.GetHerHis] hand, before my throat is cut open, blood spraying on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face. I try to ask why, but no words come out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16021_mock_duel;I know that there wasn't really anything at stake during the mock match that took place between us, yet I find myself filling with rage whenever anyone mentions [other_combatant.GetTitledName], and it's making servants flinch. But does it matter? I am the [Root.GetTitle]! Am I not allowed to loathe that [other_combatant.GetManWoman]?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16021_incapable;There are noises. Metal, clanging. A fight? Are those soldiers practicing, or is this another nightmare? The twisted face of [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName], as [other_combatant.GetSheHe] is laughing at me, after our duel? My heart racing, I still cannot move from my bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16021_default;Sometimes, when I see my soldiers practicing their sparring skills in the training grounds, the face of [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] flashes before my mind's eye, and I relive the match we fought. It sends my heart racing, how I failed to defend my honor. Some days, the shame is overwhelming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16022_incapable;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has apparently slipped into a deep slumber, and does not show any signs of waking. However, I am told that the last thing anyone heard [From.GetHerHim] talking about was our match and how [From.GetSheHe] would find a way to take revenge on me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16023_mock_duel;Since the match, I have been practicing a bit with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]. The [other_combatant.GetManWoman] did best me, and I was quick to ask for any pointers. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] seemed surprised at first, but today I am proud to tell [other_combatant.GetHerHim] that [other_combatant.GetSheHe]'s a good teacher. "And friend!" I add.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16023_default;I have recently found myself talking with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] for hours, about [other_combatant.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak]. I have to laugh, however, when the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] attempts to compliment my sparring technique  we both know that I didn't do very well, last time we sparred.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16024_mock_duel;After the match, [From.GetTitledName] asked me for advice on fighting. A little taken aback, I happily offered to train with [From.GetHerHim], on occasion. Today, [From.GetSheHe] thanks me, for being a good teacher. "And friend," [From.GetSheHe] adds, dunking me on the back, before [From.GetSheHe] cocks [From.GetHerHis] head, in direction of the ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16024_default;I have recently found myself becoming friendly with [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] chuckles heartily, however, when I attempt to compliment the [From.GetManWoman] on [From.GetHerHis] sparring technique. "My [Root.GetLordLady], we both know that I did not do very well, last time we sparred", [From.GetSheHe] says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16025_new_crush_A;Ever since we spard, I have been having daydreams, about [other_combatant.GetFirstName]. I keep seeing [other_combatant.GetHerHim] in my mind's eye, and my heart flutters. I can't tell [other_combatant.GetHerHim] though... [other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16025_new_crush_B;It's dark when I jolt awake, my heart pounding in my chest. Wiping the sweat from my brow, the memory of my dream lingers. I was sparring [other_combatant.GetFirstName] again, but instead of delivering the winning blow, this time, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] put [other_combatant.GetHerHis] arm around my waist, and pulled me in for a kiss. When will these dreams end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16025_new_crush_C;I thought I saw [other_combatant.GetFirstName] today, in the ring. I was wrong, and the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] was startled to find [other_combatant.GetHerHis] liege putting a hand on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] shoulder. Embarrassed, I fled. Oh, why does my heart long for [other_combatant.GetFirstName]? [other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16025_crushing_already;Ever since [other_combatant.GetFirstName] bested me in our match, I yearn to be near [other_combatant.GetHerHim], even more than before. I'm filled with thoughts and visions of us together, yet I dare not approach [other_combatant.GetHerHim]. [other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16025_crush_past;I've had trouble sleeping, ever since the match with [other_combatant.GetFirstName], and it's affecting my temper. When my councilors begged me to clarify my thoughts on a matter, I simply blurted out that "[other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry]";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_16029_A;My [craven_ruler.GetRootRelation] confesses that [craven_ruler.GetSheHe] has recently turned down another match [craven_ruler.GetSheHe] was challenged to.
