EVTDESCA_MNM_1901;As a scholar, I have dedicated much time to the art of studying the inner depths of the human Mind. I learned a great deal in doing so. But I should spend more time with the other specialties as well. Which one should I focus on more closely?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_1901;I shall learn more about psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_wizard_1610;Secluded at my writing desk, quill in hand and plenty a bottle of ink nearby, I find myself staring down upon the blank parchment. The sheer scale of the task upon which I am about to embark dawns upon me  I need to record my knowledge, but also use appropriate academic language...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1600;Over the past few months I have developed an elaborate academic vocabulary that I will use to record my life's work. However, before I can continue I must decide upon a direction in which to take my Thesis, as the sum of all my knowledge is simply too great to be recorded in a single book.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_wizard_1603;I will focus on the mythical Cure-All.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_wizard_1603_TT;The Cure-All would, as its name implies, cure all diseases and stop the aging process, bringing the natural human body to perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_wizard_1200_A;As I stare intently at the ink blot before me, it seems to be nothing but an ugly stain. Yet it only takes a few moments before I realize that it contains a pattern... a mirror image of the world, the past and the future.

EVTOPTA_wizard_1200_TT;You gaze into the intricate patterns splayed across you...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1201_BATTLE_A;The ink is obscure. I stare at it, unblinking, until my eyes begin to strain. It takes time, maybe hours, as time becomes fleeting.\nThen I see it. A fierce battle! I can almost hear the clanking of swords.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1201_BATTLE_B;It takes a minute, but after a while I am certain of it: I see a lion! Or... No, it's a woman. With the head of a lion!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1201_BATTLE_C;I concentrate for a long time, staring into the ink. I almost have time to doubt myself, but then I see it: a curious shape, an inky shadow, then two. It looks like a fire, and a sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1201_RELATIONSHIP_A;I see... ink stains. It looks like... ink.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1201_RELATIONSHIP_B;At first, I cannot see a single shape in the ink. I shake my head. I have to use my third eye! I close my two external eyes, and when I open them again, I see it clearly.\nA bed of flowers, and an urn.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1204_B;I am not sure what I was expecting, but this child blinks at me with the most curious eyes. I suddenly feel all my worries wash away. I must have misunderstood the vision I had during my psychoanalysis.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1205_B;I am not sure what I was expecting, but this newborn child blinks at me with the dullest of eyes. I feel my confidence wain as I hold [From.GetHerHim] and I soon give [From.GetHerHim] back to the nurse. I must have misunderstood the vision I had in the ink.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_wizard_1252_A;My [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] gave me a grueling test and recently finished evaluating it. "You'll make a fine [Root.GetHermeticsDestinedRole] one day", [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] says. While I am not sure what [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] means, I have noticed that [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] looks at me differently lately... Perhaps with pride?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1252_B;My [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] gave me a greuling test. A servant told me that it is for my own good. I am not sure what [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] gets from it, but I have noticed that [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] looks at me differently lately... "What good is another [Root.GetHermeticsDestinedRole]?" [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] sighs, and walks away.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1252_C;Before [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] passed away, I'm told that [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] prepared a special test for me and forced me to complete it.

EVTDESC_wizard_1252_D;Before [horoscope_maker.GetSheHe] passed away, I'm told that [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] had me take a special test. Servants tell me it was about my destiny, and that my [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] did not think the results were in my favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_wizard_1253;The results say what they say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1254_fighter;I wipe the sweat from my brow as [inspiring_adult.GetTitledFirstName] points out the flaws in my parrying technique. I'm glad that a [inspiring_adult.GetEducationRole] like [inspiring_adult.GetHerHim] takes time out of [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] schedule to spar with me, and fighting has in some ways become part of who I am. I sometimes wonder whether my [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] was right... Did the test tell me the results of my battles too?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1254_schemer;[inspiring_adult.GetTitledFirstName] has often inspired me to keep my eyes and ears sharp... So when I find [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] notes carelessly strewn around [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] quarters, I cannot help but wonder if [inspiring_adult.GetSheHe] intended for me to find them. "From every [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName], [Root.GetSheHe] could be the one we will remember... Will the young [Root.GetLordLady] refuse what the test has so clearly laid out for [Root.GetHerHim]?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1254_scholar;"Reading has always come naturally to you, child", [inspiring_adult.GetTitledFirstName] tells me, leaning in over my notes. "Your writing is improving as well", [inspiring_adult.GetSheHe] adds, walking back to [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] seat by the window. The [Root.GetCapitalHolding] is unusually quiet today and outside the sun is shining. Lost in thought, my mind drifts to my [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother]'s standardized test.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1255_A;I am told by the educators that my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] remains interested in [horoscope_child.GetHermeticsDestinedExpertise]. Turning my eyes upwards, I pause for a moment, marveling at how accurate the test was.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1255_B;I am told by the educators that my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] remains interested in [horoscope_child.GetHermeticsDestinedExpertise]. Turning my eyes upwards, I take a deep breath. Perhaps the test showed something that can't be changed. May it be that [horoscope_child.GetFirstName]'s destiny is out of my control?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1255_C;I am told by the educators that my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] is growing reluctant to the idea of becoming a [horoscope_child.GetHermeticsDestinedRole]. Sighing, I rub my temples. Perhaps knowing about [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] talents makes [horoscope_child.GetHerHim] anxious?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_wizard_1255_D;I am told by the educators that my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] is growing increasingly reluctant to the idea of becoming a [horoscope_child.GetHermeticsDestinedRole].

EVTOPTA_wizard_1255;I believe the test told the truth about [horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_wizard_1255;Actually, I think the test gave my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] the wrong result.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_wizard_1270_A;Over the years, I've always felt motivated to study the art of [Root.GetHermeticsDestinedExpertise]. Even once I officially finished my education, I did not feel satisfied. "There must be more to this", I urged my educators, and they have indulged me.

EVTDESC_wizard_1400;I brewed the solution just like the instructions dictated. Mere seconds after it passed my lips a wave of pleasurable sensations rolled over me!
