vadimite;Vadimite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vadimite_DESC;The Event was a traumatic experience for the Church of the Last Testament, most especially because of the death of their messiah Vissarion at the hands of unjust tyrants. However, Vadimites dispute the exact details of this episode, claiming that in Vissarion's dying breath bequeath his ministry and his role as messiah to his closest apostle Vadim rather than his Vissarion's Descendants. Vadimites further dispute the veneration of Vissarion's descendants by Vissarionites, saying that their blood relation to Vissarion holds no spiritual significance. Instead, the Vadimites hold to their scripture and the belief that, one day, their messiah will return to them once more in a different form.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

atomicist_DESC;Long ago, all the world lay under the rule of the twin gods Greed and Tyranny. Their rule was dark and insidious, enslaving all within their grasp. From this great darkness emerged a luminous Supreme Leader who rose above the masses in a brilliant rainbow, freeing the peoples of the world. With him he raised gleaming warriors who struck down the sons of despair. Through cunning and trickery however, the twin demons sowed chaos and corrupted the warriors of light, bring down everything which the Leader had so long built. In this chaos the world hung at the precipice of annihilation, and so in his despair The Leader and his most loyal guardians sacrificed themselves in the hopes of imprisoning Greed and Tyranny and saving the remaining children of light. As they took the final plunge the old world laid in a dark ashen abyss but from that void the gleaming brilliance of the Supreme Leader was reborn again as the Eternal Sun and the guardian spirits as the stars.

He was immortalized as the Lord Shopping by a Hong emissary for his “Golden Rule” praising beauty above all else. His teachings about Shang were passed on by his descendants who continue to bring great prosperity and wealth to China. However, like many things it was not to last, a delegation of four bureaucrats claiming to serve the Hong Emperors ingratiate themselves in the Court of the last Lord Shopping. Their insidious plot was revealed when they drop their forms revealing themselves as the jealous old four stealing from the Lord Shopping the Desires and Care for the world and their great wealth. While a court official of the Hong was able to vanquish the Old Lords back for whence it came, the wicked deed has been committed. Many disciples of the Lord Shopping lamented as their sovereign was taken by the void of desire. It is through these disciples who continue to call the illustrious Lord, they hope may once more grace China with the Essence of Wealth and Beauty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nousthreskeia_DESC;The central tenet of Nousthreskeia is the concept of the "Noosphere", an invisible field that surrounds the Earth and is affected by the collective thoughts and feelings of humanity. Followers of Nousthreskeia believe that the Noosphere is capable of altering both the collective human consciousness and physical reality itself, and that the Event was the result of artificial interference with the Noosphere. This interference damaged the Noosphere, knocking the physical world and the consciousness of humanity back to a more primitive state. Nousthrestkeists believe that humanity will not recover from the Event until this damage to the Noosphere has been healed and that a "Wish Granter" exists somewhere in the world that can accomplish this goal almost instantaneously if used properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tirthaist;Tirthaist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tirthaist_DESC;Hinduism reached Indonesia thousands of years ago, merging into the local religions and solidifying itself as the most popular religion in the region. After the rise of Islam it was restricted to a few small areas. Dominated by Islam, the already unique and idiosyncratic practices of the Balinese Hindus become more sharply influenced by Islamic doctrine, and more specifically the monotheism that was required of them. All gods are emanations of Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa The Great Cosmic Order, however the most important is Siwa, who is seen as the chief manifestation of God and ruler over all. Second to him is his "little brother" Buddha, who governs a separate class of priests. Subject to Siwa are the 4 other chief gods, Mahadewa, Iswara, Brahma, and Wisnu as well as his wife, Uma. The elaborate cosmology of Balinese Hinduism is less important to the practice than the daily rituals, many of which center on the use of holy water and the practice of sacrifices to appease both the gods of Dharma and the demons of Adharma. These sacrifices are performed by the Pedandas of both Siwa and Buddha and are accompanied by a litany from a lontar manuscript. Many of these sacrifices are dedicated to the Kanda Mpat,the five spirits that are born with every person, representing Siwa and his subject gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Worship is done of a single form in order to perceive that aspect of the godhead and seek Union with him. Especially in Southeast Asia one of the avatars of Vishnu is believed to be the auspicous Buddha themselves. Furthermore, while previously the most popular form was Krishna, in the post-event world people are more apt to worship Kaliki in order to bring him to restore Dharma to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The school, later simply called Renewalist or Modernist, are critical of the traditional Islam practiced on the archipelago on two counts: their syncretic practices and their penchant for "blind" taqlid at the expense of tajdid. They called for Muslims to shed away their 'superstitions', 'heresies', and 'syncretism' to return Islam to it's 'pure' state as it had been in the time of the Prophet. The movement primarily adheres to Athariyyah or Ashariyyah and elegates madhab to the background, preferring tajdid and tarjih as a mean of fiqh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Theologically, the movement is a champion of Athariyyah theology. This movement also emphasizes strict adherence to the Quran and Hadith, often adopting a literalist interpretation of Islamic texts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nusantara_DESC;Islam had came to the land of Nusantara by merchants and wandering saints. The practice that evolved as a result of the intermingling between local tradition and those of distant land with their tarekat, slowly coalesced under the tutelage of kyais, syehs, and teukus. The followers of their teaching, weathered against the tide of Renewalism, simply identify themselves as Ahlul Sunnah wal Jamaah, Aswaja for short. These traditionalist follows the Ashariyyah theology and practices Syafi'i madhab, and may follow one of the teaching of sufi tarekat spread across the archipelago. Their relative tolerance towards local customs form a unique cosmopolitan expression of faith that more conservative Sunni Madhabs found in Asia dismiss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bani_DESC;When the words of the Prophet arrived to the ports on the backs of merchants from far-off lands, it was but one of many faiths that have crossed the rich lands of the Cham but over time and many tribulations the Cham had turned Islam's Message into their very own. With many schools of thought and great debate a vibrant array of jurisprudence and traditions has arisen on the edges of the Islamic World. Among the most celebrated of all festivals is of Ramuwan when the many villages would unite to feast and dine with the martyrs of old. There is many disagreements on the fine details but all agree that to them the message the Prophet revealed was that of living true and righteous in the face of great struggles to one day bring lasting peace for their people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
