Followers of Nousthreskeia believe that the Noosphere is capable of altering both the collective human consciousness and physical reality itself, and that the Event was the result of artificial interference with the Noosphere. This interference damaged the Noosphere, knocking the physical world and the consciousness of humanity back to a more primitive state. Nousthrestkeists believe that humanity will not recover from the Event until this damage to the Noosphere has been healed and that a "Wish Granter" exists somewhere in the world that can accomplish this goal almost instantaneously if used properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

sanmin_DESC;Heralding from the Island of Taiwan the sage Fo Zaizhi, a teacher believed to have lived during the early years of unrest between the Great Qing to Great Hong, is regarded in the Island as highly as the illustrious lineage of Kong Fuzi. Believers of his teachings hold that within all humans are the three principle truths: The External, The Internal, and Fraternity, through the understanding of the three it is believed one can attain true wisdom through harmony. In this sense, believers are known to walk among the common folk to be leaders in this world so that they may guide people to a just and true realm ruled by the departed Fo Zaizhi who is a triad of souls said to embody each of his principles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Indian or Hindu-Derived Religions

hindu_DESC;Sanatan Dharma, commonly known as Hinduism has a multiplicity of forms that regard each other as somewhat valid variations of the tradition, valuing the four goals of life - Kama, Arth, Dharma, and Moksha - as well as sacred texts passed down from the ancient sages. While sectarian squabbles dominate the subcontinent, the Hindus of East Asia have searched for common ground in order to survive while surrounded by hostile groups.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tirthaist_DESC;Hinduism reached Indonesia thousands of years ago, merging into the local religions and solidifying itself as the most popular religion in the region. After the rise of Islam it was restricted to a few small areas. Dominated by Islam, the already unique and idiosyncratic practices of the Balinese Hindus become more sharply influenced by Islamic doctrine, and more specifically the monotheism that was required of them. All gods are emanations of Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa The Great Cosmic Order, however the most important is Siwa, who is seen as the chief manifestation of God and ruler over all. Second to him is his "little brother" Buddha, who governs a separate class of priests. Subject to Siwa are the 4 other chief gods, Mahadewa, Iswara, Brahma, and Wisnu as well as his wife, Uma. The elaborate cosmology of Balinese Hinduism is less important to the practice than the daily rituals, many of which center on the use of holy water and the practice of sacrifices to appease both the gods of Dharma and the demons of Adharma. These sacrifices are performed by the Pedandas of both Siwa and Buddha and are accompanied by a litany from a lontar manuscript. Many of these sacrifices are dedicated to the Kanda Mpat,the five spirits that are born with every person, representing Siwa and his subject gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Muslims
hui;Huízú;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hui_DESC;Huíjiào, the religion of the Hui, represents a cultural understanding of the essence of Islam - Truth and Purity, as sublime characteristics of the One God. A defining difference that sets them apart from other Muslims is their veneration of the sage wisdoms of Kongzhi and their adoption of many Chinese customs. The traditions of Islamic thought live on through the scholarly muses of Ma Scholars who, like their Confucian peers, believe in the orderly dispension of Heaven to be paramount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
salafi;Salafi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
salafi_DESC;A so called “Return to Tradition” they like Wahabbi dogmatically approach Islam with the ideas of “returning” to the sense of Purity and success of the Early Muslim expansions since the life of the Prophet Muhammad. This is achieved by believing the Quran alone can suffice understand and that (some adherence) do not recognize taqliqh and vehemently disapproves of the concept of Islamic Saints and their veneration. Considered extremely conservative by other branches of Sunni and the wider Islamic World they seek to return it to a pure existence unpolluted by interpretation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mormon_DESC;With roots in The Ancient Lands to the East, Mormonism have been one of many ancient traditions of the Polynesians, who they believe to be the lost tribe of Hagoth. Although based on Christian foundations, the Church of Latter-Day Saints has many additional books and highly divergent theology, which have caused it to be treated differently from mainstream Christianity. With the chaos of the apocalypse, these attitudes were exacerbated, and Mormonism is now treated as a wholly distinct entity from other Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jewish_DESC;Long ago the believers of the one supreme God of the universe came to the Dragon Throne seeking refugee from their great exile. Far from their homeland they came to view thier adopted home as a land of milk and honey, their communities gather around a holy institution containing the written history of their people. The flames of wisdom and debate maintained in their mullah who continue to uphold their ancient convenant. While the Event ravaged the Middle Kingdom to its foundations like so many sad stories of their people they persevered seeking once more to heal a world cast away from the shining gleam of the Almighty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
