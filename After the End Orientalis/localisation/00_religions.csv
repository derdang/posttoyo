At the Council of Singapore in 2114, Protestant Christians reached a concordance on basic Protestant doctrines and theology to establish the new Concordanist Convention. The Concordanists are mostly centered in Southeast Asia, as Protestant Christians further north mostly reject the Council of Singapore due to its incompatibility with their three principles, particularly their own self-governance in opposition to the Presiding Bishop in Singapore.

vadimite;Vadimite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vadimite_DESC;The Event was a traumatic experience for the Church of the Last Testament, most especially because of the death of their messiah Vissarion at the hands of unjust tyrants.

Vadimites further dispute the veneration of Vissarion's descendants by Vissarionites, saying that their blood relation to Vissarion holds no spiritual significance. Instead, the Vadimites hold to their scripture and the belief that, one day, their messiah will return to them once more in a different form.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Most Rizalistas also believe in the divinity of José Rizal, which puts them at odds with the Catholic Church and other Christians. After the Event, these differences only became more stark especially after the Archprimate of Asia gained a stronger grip over Manila and the surrounding area. Rizalistas have been increasingly marginalized by the Archprimate and its adherents, but this marginalization also gives it more legitimacy to the peasantry, who sometimes lead uprisings against the oppression of the nobility and the Church in the name of Rizal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Their insidious plot was revealed when they drop their forms revealing themselves as the jealous old four stealing from the Lord Shopping the Desires and Care for the world and their great wealth. While a court official of the Hong was able to vanquish the Old Lords back for whence it came, the wicked deed has been committed.

tirthaist_DESC;Hinduism reached Indonesia thousands of years ago, merging into the local religions and solidifying itself as the most popular religion in the region. After the rise of Islam it was restricted to a few small areas. Dominated by Islam, the already unique and idiosyncratic practices of the Balinese Hindus become more sharply influenced by Islamic doctrine, and more specifically the monotheism that was required of them. All gods are emanations of Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa The Great Cosmic Order, however the most important is Siwa, who is seen as the chief manifestation of God and ruler over all. Second to him is his "little brother" Buddha, who governs a separate class of priests. Subject to Siwa are the four other chief gods, Mahadewa, Iswara, Brahma, and Wisnu as well as his wife, Uma. The elaborate cosmology of Balinese Hinduism is less important to the practice than the daily rituals, many of which center on the use of holy water and the practice of sacrifices to appease both the gods of Dharma and the demons of Adharma. These sacrifices are performed by the Pedandas of both Siwa and Buddha and are accompanied by a litany from a lontar manuscript. Many of these sacrifices are dedicated to the Kanda Mpat,the five spirits that are born with every person, representing Siwa and his subject gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

salafi_DESC;In the 17th century, in the desert of Arabia, a movement had arisen, calling for the total purification of the Islamic faith from idolatry and heresy. The movement, Salafism, teaches a  conservative and puritanical interpretation of Islam that aims to emulate the practices and beliefs of the early generations of Muslims, known as the Salaf. Theologically, the movement is a champion of Athariyyah theology. This movement also emphasizes strict adherence to the Quran and Hadith, often adopting a literalist interpretation of Islamic texts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nusantara_DESC;Islam had came to the land of Nusantara by merchants and wandering saints. The practice that evolved as a result of the intermingling between local tradition and those of distant land with their tarekat, slowly coalesced under the tutelage of kyais, syehs, and teukus. The followers of their teaching, weathered against the tide of Renewalism, simply identify themselves as Ahlul Sunnah wal Jamaah, Aswaja for short. These traditionalist follows the Ashariyyah theology and practices Syafi'i madhab, and may follow one of the teaching of sufi tarekat spread across the archipelago. Their relative tolerance towards local customs form a unique cosmopolitan expression of faith that more conservative Sunni Madhabs found in Asia dismiss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

kebatinan_DESC;Before any of the foreign faith came to Nusantara, the people of the isles worshipped many gods and goddesses. The arrival of Islam assimilated many of these faith and integrate many of the ritual into the mosaic of tradition, recontextualizing them. But the ancient faith hangs on, intermingling with the practices of Islam along the way. The tradition that endures now are the faith of the mystics, in which inner faith triumph over orthodoxy and ritualism, in which God lies in one's heart instead of faraway land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bani;Bani Cham;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bani_DESC;When the words of the Prophet arrived to the ports on the backs of merchants from far-off lands, it was but one of many faiths that have crossed the rich lands of the Cham but over time and many tribulations the Cham had turned Islam's Message into their very own. With many schools of thought and great debate a vibrant array of jurisprudence and traditions has arisen on the edges of the Islamic World. Among the most celebrated of all festivals is of Ramuwan when the many villages would unite to feast and dine with the martyrs of old. There is many disagreements on the fine details but all agree that to them the message the Prophet revealed was that of living true and righteous in the face of great struggles to one day bring lasting peace for their people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mormon_DESC;With roots in The Ancient Lands to the East, Mormonism have been one of many ancient traditions of the Polynesians, who they believe to be the lost tribe of Hagoth. Although based on Christian foundations, the Church of Latter-Day Saints has many additional books and highly divergent theology, which have caused it to be treated differently from mainstream Christianity. With the chaos of the apocalypse, these attitudes were exacerbated, and Mormonism is now treated as a wholly distinct entity from other Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jewish_DESC;Long ago the believers of the one supreme God of the universe came to the Dragon Throne seeking refugee from their great exile. Far from their homeland they came to view thier adopted home as a land of milk and honey, their communities gather around a holy institution containing the written history of their people. The flames of wisdom and debate maintained in their mullah who continue to uphold their ancient convenant. While the Event ravaged the Middle Kingdom to its foundations like so many sad stories of their people they persevered seeking once more to heal a world cast away from the shining gleam of the Almighty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
