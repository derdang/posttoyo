- Liangguang
	- Replace duplicate counties name in Guangxi
- Yunnan

	- County previously defined as Pinlaung is actually part of Kayin State. Those baronies have been merged to another Shan county.
-- 16-17 January 2021 -- Shan State
yeah sorry too tired for detailed Readme rn. I fill the barony as best as I could but I might might've place latter baronies in wrong counties. /shrug
Also by filling, I might use Thai names in tail-end baronies as I can't find any name whatsoever.

Props to Shan language Wikipedia for included IPA and English name in their township links. It helps me filling out some.

-- 13 January 2021 -- Update Liangguang. Now with entire Dali (or most of it. I might missed some) = =w
- 7 (seven!) cultures. Oh boy. (Zhuang is one of them though. Dont worry)
	- "Xinan" culture for Southwestern Han/ Mandarin speaker.
	- Wa, Miao, Yi, Hani, etc. @_@
- No religions defined yet. (More Hui?)
- De jure 'Empire' of Dali (i.e. Kingdom of Dali/Nanzhao). Kingdom of Yunnan (i.e. Yunnan province)
	- The de jure capital is Kunming though. (Formable title could change that to Dali later. I guess) 
	- Both Kunming and Dali amalgating some surrounding divisions to be viable duchies. 
		- Both capital have a single county on current map for some reason. :thinking:
 
- Baronies name are still placeholder. All counties and duchies are named though.

-- 1 October 2020 -- Mariana Andaman
	Note :  - The define and it's result wasn't tested in the game. May need bugfixing.
			- Empire title is a placeholder. Surely there should be more conditions to form an Empire out of 5 islands
				- It is especially needed for Micronesia if my two-kingdoms idea being implemented. 
			
Define counties in Micronesia (Empire of Day-begins to avoid association with the rest of Micronesia or F.S.Micronesia)
	- 4 counties, Every island a duchy. *insert Huey Long picture*
	- 2 kingdoms, Mariana (Guam and N.Mariana) and West Caroline (Palau and Yap State)
	- N. Mariana is Catholic. The rest is Americanist
	- All culture have prefix mn_
		N. Mariana and Guam have "mn_mariana" culture
		Palau have "mn_palauan". Yap have "mn_micronesian"
		
Define counties in Andaman and Nicobar island. 

	- Empire title called "Maha Andaman". Although I am tempted to call it "Swaraj" :S
	- Kingdom is "Andaman and Nicobar"
		- Nicobar island is 1 duchy/county. 
		- Andaman have 2 duchies and 5 counties. 
			- South Andaman, capital of kingdom/empire title. 3 counties. South Andaman, Little Andaman and Havelock Island.
			- North Andaman as shorthand of irl "North and Middle Andaman district". Two counties of exactly what longer name is.
	- 2 culture and 3 religions in this part 
		- Bengali in North and Middle. "Andaman" culture in other counties. 
		- North/Middle/South is Hindu. Sunni (or what Maritime Sea will have) in Havelock island. Pagan in the rest.
	
	- North and South Sentinel islands are intentionally being the last barony in the 7 for South and Nicobar county. Respectively 
	
----------
-- 2 September 2020 -- Dongbei and Thailand.
Dongbei 
	- only Jilin were defined with map file's color. Most provinces still lack barony names and number of holding.
	- colorcheck column are added to quickly check if there are duplicate rgb anywhere. It tend to happen with copy-paste.
	- 11 out of maybe 32 counties in Liaoning is named and paired with rgb.
	- Heilongjiang is undefined, and current amount of counties are way too few.
		(I consider redraw it sometimes in the future, and preferably define it at the same time. That or I will forgot most details by next month :S)

[Thailand note were omitted as it is completed]
